## part 0 - make errors

# Uncomment the lines below and fix all of the syntax and logical errors in this statement. It should 
# print "Print this when there are no errors"
# my_error = Its not working!"
# if "working" not in my_error
#     print"Print this when there are no errors")
# ese: 
#     print("its still not working


## Part 1 - Basic math 
# make a variable called my_pi and make it 3.14


# make a variable called radius_inches, give it the value 5 as a float 
# use the my_pi variable you made to calculate the area of a circle with
# that radius


# Modify your program so that radius_inches is taken from a user input


# Modify your program so that the area of the circle is only calculated
# if the user inputs more than 10



# Make another variable, with an appropriate name,
# that converts radius_inches to centimeters and displays both inches and 
# centimeters in a sentence. 
# To get centimeters, multiply the inch value by 2.54
# # use print(f'') to print the string 



## Part 2 math module
# import math into this file


# print pi using the math module


# Make a variable called math_radius and make it a float with the value five
# use math.pi to find the circumference and store it in a 
# variable named circle_circumference 
# use print(f'') to print a string that displays the radius and circumference



# Make a variable called square_root_me and ask the user to input an integer
# Print the user input and result of the square root of that number using the math module


# Make a variable called my_number and another called power_of which both
# take user input. Use the math module to print the user inputs, the result of my_number 
# to the power of power_of



# If I have a right angle triangle that has a opposite side of 5 inches, and a
# adjacent side of 3 inches, find the missing side and the degrees or radians
# of all of the angles of the triangle. Store them all in appropriately 
# named variables and print them in a print(f'') string 




# Modify this code to accept user input for the adjacent and opposite sides
# of the triangle and display in radians 




## Part 3 - Strings + Math

# Create a program that asks the user if they want the area or circumference of 
# a circle. Then ask them what the radius of the circle is. Store their 
# answer in appropriately named variables. 
# if the user asked for area, calculate the area, if they asked for 
# circumference, calculate circumference 
# and display the result. 




# Create a program that asks the user for their favorite ice cream flavor
# use the length of their response (the number of characters in 
# the string) as their lucky number. Display their lucky number 



# BONUS QUESTION # 
# A circular room with a radius of 5 m can hold 10 people
# for every additional 1m of radius, the room can hold 5 more people
# Given the number of people as input, print the area of the circle that holds them
# if there are less than 10 people the room is 5m
