## Explain the following problem as Purpose, Input, and Output
# If there is a factory with any number of workers, and they are all working 8 hour shifts
# and earning 14 dollars an hour, what is the cost to pay all the workers, per day? 
# Ask for the input inside the function

# Purpose: 
# Input: 
# Output: 

# Write pseudo code for the above problem 


## Now write and call this problem as a single function called worker_wages. Then call the function. 


## write the purpose, input, and output for this function, and 
#  pseudo code for a function called grocery_boxes that solves this problem:
# In every grocery box there are at 3 fruits, two pieces of meat, and 4 canned goods. 
# Inside the function, Ask for the user to input how many times per week they want the box delivered. 
# How many items are given each week, based on user input?
# Print the total items delivered per week. 

# Purpose: 
# input 
# output: 


## Make a new function similar to grocery_boxes but ask the user for how many of each item they want in their grocery box. This
# new function is named grocery_boxes_cost. Have it print the total cost assuming
# fruits are 1$, meat is 5$ and cans are 2$
# Print in the following strict format using print(f''): 
# You ordered {how_may_per_week} boxes per week, with {fruits} fruits, {cans} cans, {meat} meats, and it cost {total}$

#  Write the purpose, input and output

# Purpose: 
# Input: 
# output:


# Create a function weather_outside that takes no parameters. Inside the function, ask the user is asked 
# what the temp is outside as temp_outside
# Create a boolean variable called is_cold. If temp_outside is less than 15, make is_cold true and print is_cold. 
# Do not call the function. 



#Now call the function. 


# Create a function called my_input_function that takes no parameters. Ask the user to input two numbers, add them
# together and print the result. Call the function.
