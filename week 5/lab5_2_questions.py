# Write piece of code that adds "rat" at position 1 in the list below
# print the result 
animals = ["lions", "tigers", "bears" ]
print(enumerate(animals))
print(type(enumerate(animals)))


#Write a piece of code that removes the element 3 of the animals list and
# print the result  


# Write a loop that turns the list into all capital letters. 
# Print the entire animals list in all capitals (not just each element)


# Make a new list called num_chars that contains only the number of characters in 
# each element of the animals list
# Print the new num_chars list


# Make a function called animal_list_checker that takes no parameters.
# Create a loop that asks the user for an animal. If the animal 
# is in the possible_animals list and not in the animals list,
# add it to the animals list and print "Added the animal"
# if it isn't in the possible_animals list, add it to the rejected_animals list and print
# "rejected animal" 
# If the animal is already in the animals, print "its already at {index}" 
# and ends the loop"
# When the loop is done, return a list of rejected animal. 
# Write a docstring to describe the function. 
# Do not call the function

# Use these lists 
# animals = ["lion", "tiger", "bear"]
# possible_animals = ["fish", "bird", "cat", "dog" ]


# Write a function called animal_shout that takes one parameter,
# a list of strings. The function should print each element of the
# list in all capital letters without altering the list. 


#call animal_shout with the returned list of animal_list_checker 

# Create a loop that iterates through each element of 
# the num_list list below and removes every element that 
# contains the number 3 and put them in a new list called
# three_nums. Print both lists. 
num_list = ["339", "62", "592", "94", "4", "43", "542"]


# Make the same function work with the following list too:
tricky_num_list = ["339", "362", "592", "94", "34", "43", "542"]


# Write a function called sq_nums that takes an list of integers
# The function should return a new list that 
# contains only the square root of each element in the list


# Call that function sq_nums with the list below and print the 
# second element in the new list
sq_list = [34,36,1,77,352,485]
