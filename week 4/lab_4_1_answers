# Write a function called keyword_finder that takes two parameters, a phrase and a keyword
# If the keyword appears in the phrase, determine how many times it appears 
# in the phrase and the index of when it first appears. Print
# f"{Keyword} is in the phrase, it appears {times} times , first at index {index}
# If the word does not appear in the phrase, display how many characters are in 
# both the phrase and the keyword in a f'' string 
#Make sure this works regardless of the UPPER CASE or lower case letters
# Do not call the function. 



# Now call the function with the keyword "TEST" and the phrase "This is a test"


# Your output should be: 
# test is in the phrase, it appears 1, first at 10

#Now call the function again but with user input as parameters stored as variables
